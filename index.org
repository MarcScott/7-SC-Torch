** Introduction

A company has been asked to design and make a pocket-sized device that
can aid people to see the keyhole for their car and front door in the
dark. Lighting & inspection personnel specialists (liPS) have produced a
pocket sized LED torch that will fit onto a key ring, so will always be
at hand. They have passed this design onto Bourne Grammar School to
design the PCB and create the finished product.

Your task is to research into components and create a PCB that will fit
into the casing of the Torch, re-design the case on 2D techsoft, so that
it can be precision cut on the laser cutter, assemble and finish the
product to the high quality standard that LiPS are renown for.

To create the product to the high standard that is required you need to
research into a few areas first, below is a spider diagram of things you
need to research. [[images/MindMap.png]]
** Research plan summary.

You'll need to research the different subject areas as previously. To
keep your research focussed you will try to look at them in the
following order:

1. Resistor - What it is, what it does, what a resistance is, is there a
   circuit symbol for it.
2. LED - What it is, what it does, is there a circuit symbol for it.
3. Plastics and fixings - What categories, how to fix them together.
4. Circuit - What is a circuit, how do you make a circuit, what is a
   PCB, how do I make a PCB.

You will put all my findings into a portfolio to help manage the
project. You can use the portfolio as part of a pitch to the client
explaining how you reached the design and final product.
* Planning your project

** The Plan

To complete this project successfully and to a high enough standard that
is acceptable of any good craftsman, you must be wise with your time.

You will only have 6 x 1 hour lessons in school, so therefore you are
trusted to complete this project in your own time at lunch, at home or
both.

[[#][[[https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png]]]]
** Gantt charts

Gantt charts help you to plan your project and to keep to deadlines.

Below is an example Gantt chart. You simple place crosses in the box for
each task showing the dates you will be working on it.

[[#][[[https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png]]]]
** Your own Gantt chart

[[documents/Gantt_chart.docx][Download the Gantt chart here]]
You need to fill this in and try and keep to the deadlines you set. It
will be useful for you to review your Gantt chart at the end of the
project to help evaluate how you managed your time.

* Resistors

[[#][[[https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png]]]]
** Colour codes

[[images/colour_codes.png]]
[[#][[[https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png]]]]
** Colour codes

When reading a resistor, hold it so the three colour bands that are
close together are on your left, you now read the bands from left to
right.

[[images/colour_example.png]]
So therefore this resistor value is 560 ohms + or -- 28 (5%) This equals
a value between 532 ohms and 588 ohms

** Resistors

Download [[documents/Resistors.docx][worksheet]] and complete it to
consolidate your learning on Resistors.

* LEDs

[[#][[[https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png]]]]
** LEDs

LED is an acronym for Light Emitting Diode.

[[http://rsandas.com/images/LED_Multi_color.jpg]]
As well as emitting light when current passes through an LED, they only
allow current to flow one way.

[[#][[[https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png]]]]
** LEDs and Current Flow

Conventional current flows from positive to negative, so we must make
sure we place our diodes in a circuit the correct way around. We connect
the anode to the positive and the cathode to the negative.

** LEDs Worksheet

Download [[documents/LEDs.docx][worksheet]] and complete it to
consolidate your learning on LEDs.

* Plastics

[[#][[[https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png]]]]
** Types of Plastic

There are two types of plastic. You're going to need to do some research
on plastics using the Web and any other resources you can find.

[[documents/Plastics.docx][Download and fill in this document on
plastics.]]
* Components

[[#][[[https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png]]]]
** Components task

[[documents/Components.docx][Download this document]]You'll need to
complete the table provided by finding names, circuit symbols and images
of the components used in your project.

* Drilling your PCB

[[#][[[https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png]]]]
** What you'll need to do

1. Clean the PCB and drill the correct size holes.
2. Take pictures for your portfolio
3. Write about what you have achieved at this stage. Explain in detail,
   label the picture and use keywords correctly.

[[#][[[https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png]]]]
** Tutorial

* Soldering your PCB

[[#][[[https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png]]]]
** What you'll need to do

1. Select the right components
2. Place them on the board the correct way round
3. Remember that some components have a positive and negative
4. Solder them onto the tracks
5. Take pictures for your portfolio
6. Write about what you have achieved at this stage. Explain in detail,
   label the picture and use keywords correctly.

[[#][[[https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png]]]]
** Step-by-step guide

1. The switch will only fit one way, with the legs of the switch facing
   towards the shorter sides of the PCB.
2. The LED is 3mm in size, and must be soldered with the LED flush
   against the top side of the board.
3. LEDs are polarised so must be soldered the right way around. The
   positive (longer) leg of the LEDs must be soldered to a “+” LED pad
   on the PCB.
4. The 1 Ω Resistor can be positioned either way
5. Strip and solder around 5cm of solid core wire in the holes marked
   +3v and -- (these will be used to connect to the batteries within the
   case)
