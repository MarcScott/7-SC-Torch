** Step 1. Cleaning

When I was given my Printed Circuit board (PCB) I cleaned the copper
tracks with fine grade wire wool to remove the dirt (oxidization). This
was so that when I soldered my components to it they would stick first
time without the track lifting, as I have learnt that solder does not
stick to a dirty track.
