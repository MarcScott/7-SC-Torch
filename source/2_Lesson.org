- Resistance is measured in Ω
- You know that the narrower the wire through which electricity passes, the more the resistance it has.
- The most common type of resistors called /Carbon Film/ resistors are made up of a carbon tube into which a grooves have been cut. The grooves mean there is less carbon for the current to pass through, so the resistance can be increased by having a deeper groove.

- Resistors are colour coded so we can tell what there resistance is.
- Most resistors have 4 bands painted on the outside.
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Resistor.JPG
- Starting at the opposite end to the Gold or Silver band (In this image that would be the right hand side):
  - The first band gives us the first number
  - The second band give us the second number
  - The third band gives us the number of zeros.
  - The fourth bands gives us the tolerance.

| Green  | 5        | 5        | 5                     |           |
| Blue   | 6        | 6        | 6                     |           |
| Violet | 7        | 7        | 7                     |           |
| Gray   | 8        | 8        | 8                     |           |
| White  | 9        | 9        | 9                     |           |
| Gold   |          |          |                       | 5%        |
| Silver |          |          |                       | 10%       |
- So for example, the resistor pictured above has the colours:
  1. Brown - 1
  2. Black - 0
  3. Yellow -4
  4. Gold - +/-5%
- This means it is a 100000Ω resistor, or what we would normally call a 100kΩ resistor.
