- =Light Emitting Diodes= are a fairly modern invention. The first practical LED componenets were only developed in 1962, unlike the light bulb which has been around since the late 1800s.
- LEDs emit light when a voltage is applied across them. They last a long time, use very little energy and are vey cheap to manufacture. This makes them superior to light bulbs in many applications.
- Despite how much LEDs are used, new types are still being developed.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
On October 7, 2014, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura for "the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources" or, less formally, LED lamps.

- Find out how many different colours of LED there are. Try and find a picture to illustrate this.

- LEDs can only be placed in a circuit one way round. (You'll learn why in a bit).
- They have one leg that is the cathode and another that is the anode.
- There are several ways to recognise which side of the LED is which.
| Anode                | Cathode               |
|----------------------+-----------------------|
| positive(+)          | negative(-)           |
| rounded edge         | flat edge             |
| longest leg          | shortest leg          |
| small triangle(post) | large triangle(anvil) |
- Compare this list to the diagram above, so you know what the parts are.

- Find an LED and take a photo of it using your phone or tablet (or your teacher's). Make sure you get a close up.
- Use a graphics package to try and label the photo, like the diagram aboce.

- LEDs contain two different types of material, one that carries positive charges called /=holes=/ and one that carries negative chatges - the electrons we met in the last lesson.
- The holes try to flow from the anode towards the cathode.
- The electrons try to flow from the cathode to the anode.
- This flow of charges means that current is flowing through the LED.
- If an electron and a hole meet each other, they produce a particle of light.

- The animation should show you why LEDs can only be used one way around.
- Try hitting the /=polarity=/ button to reverse the way the LED is connected.
- You should see that the charges are stuck at either end, and therefore no current is flowing, and no light is emitted.
