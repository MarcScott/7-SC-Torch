- =Light Emitting Diodes= are a fairly modern invention. The first practical LED componenets were only developed in 1962, unlike the light bulb which has been around since the late 1800s.
- LEDs emit light when a voltage is applied across them. They last a long time, use very little energy and are vey cheap to manufacture. This makes them superior to light bulbs in many applications.
- Despite how much LEDs are used, new types are still being developed.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
On October 7, 2014, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura for "the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources" or, less formally, LED lamps.
