- We're now going to deign our LED Torch.
- The first thing we'll need to do is design a circuit and a PCB. To do this we use a program called /Circuit Wizard/.
** Design It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: design
:END:

- Find the Circuit Wizard application and open it.
- Click on File in the menu bar and then New from the context menu.
- Choose =Circuit with GENIE Flowchart= from the dialogue box and click OK.
[[file:img/CW1.png]]
- On the far right of the screen you'll see a gallery of components you can use.
[[file:img/CW2.png]]
- Choose =Power Supplies= and then find the symbol for a =Cell=
file:img/CW3.png
- Drag a single Cell onto the page, and then another one.
- You should arrange them so that they are connected together.
file:img/CW4.png
- When we connect up cells in this way, we are making a battery. Our LED Torch will be powered by 2 1.5V Cells, giving us a total Voltage of 3V.
- Next we need an LED. In the Gallery, find the Light Emitting Diodes.

- Drag an LED onto your page and rotate.
file:img/CW6.png
- Now we need to connect up the LED to the cells.
- You can do this by clicking and dragging on the end points of the LED, to create a wire.

** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:

- It's up to you to finish the circuit now.
- You'll need to put in a =Push To Make= switch and a resistor, and then connect it back up to the cells.
- It should look like this when you are finished.
file:img/CW8.png
- You'll need to change the resistor value to 3Ω. To do this, double click on the resistor to reveal it's properties. Make sure it's not 3kΩ
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:

- Let's try out our circuit.
- In the tool bar at the top of the screen is a play button.
file:img/CW9.png
- Click the button and then test out your circuit by pushing the switch.
- Now let's make it more realistic.
- From the menu choose Project --> Simulation and turn on explosions.
- Now run your circuit and see what happens.
* Assessment

- In your own words, explain what happend when you simulated the circuit.
- Describe how you could make sure this doesn't happen.

- Different LEDs can take larger currents than others.
- Change your resistor back to 3Ω if you altered it, and double click the LED and change it to a =White= LED.
- Now simulate the circuit and you should see that everything works as expected.
* Designing a PCB

- A PCB is a Printed Circuit Board. This is a laminate material with copper printed on the surface that allows current to flow through it.
- The PCB you'll be using in your LED Torch looks like this

- Let's use Circuit Wizard to design the PCB
- Click on the icon shown in the toolbar to start the PCB wizard.
[[file:img/PCB/PCB3.png]]
- Click on Next
file:img/PCB/PCB3.png
- Choose the option =Single-Sided; Thin Tacks= and don't forget to uncheck the tick box at the bottom.
