- When engineers have to complete large projects, they often rely on Gantt charts to help them organise themselves.
- A Gantt chart contains all the tasks you need to complete, and a date on whcih they will be completed.
- The Gantt chart below contains all the tasks for this project.
| Lesson | Research | Circuit Design | Housing Design | Soldering | Assembly |

- There are three distinct areas for you to research for this project.
  1. Resistors
  2. LEDs
  3. Plastics

- Electricity is often described as a flow of electrons (tiny particles with a negative charge that you'll learn about in Science).
- Look at the animation below to see electrons flowing through a wire.
- The rate at which electrons are flowing (the number of electrons passing through a component each second) is called the /electric current/, and is measured in /Amps/
- A resistor acts to reduce the number of electrons that can flow through a wire each second.
- The higher the /resistance/ of a resistor, the greater effect it has on electric current.
